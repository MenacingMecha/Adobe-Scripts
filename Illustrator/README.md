# Layers_To_PNG
## This script is intended to be used for icon production
All of the icons are set at 24px X 24px and the script exports them as PNG at a final size of 800px X 800px.
The script will ask you to select a folder with all of your Illustrator files in them. Then ask you to input a file type. Typically for this script you would use *.ai to select all the Illustrator files.
Then select the output folder where you want all of your PNG's to be.
It will generate PNGSs based on the layer name in your Illustrator file.
File names are generated by using the Illustrator file name with an underscore with the layer name after it.


#Layers_To_SVG
## This script is intended to be used for icon production
This is roughly the same script as Layers_To_PNG however is saves the file as an SVG.
Note, there is a slight bug in the naming of the file. 
The file name will have the orginal Illustrator file name but tack on layer names after the underscrore.


# Roadmap
- [ ] Create UI for allowing custom export size of PNG
