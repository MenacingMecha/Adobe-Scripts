# Layers_To_PNG
This script allows for exporting all layers in your document as PNG files.<br>
Once the script is loaded you will be prompted to select a folder with your illustrator files<br>
You will then be asked to select a folder where all of your exported files wish to live<br>
A dialog box will then appear to ask for the final width and height of the exported PNG. <b>Please use pixels for this</b><br>
<br>
<b>Note</b>: For this to work correctly, you must add and underscore to the end of your file name. E.g. MyFirstIcon_.ai
