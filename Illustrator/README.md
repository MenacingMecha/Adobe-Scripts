# Layers_To_PNG
## This script is intended to be used for icon production
All of the icons are set at 24px X 24px and the script exports them as PNG at a final size of 800px X 800px.<br/>
The script will ask you to select a folder with all of your Illustrator files in them. Then ask you to input a file type. <br/>
Typically for this script you would use *.ai to select all the Illustrator files.<br/>
Then select the output folder where you want all of your PNG's to be.<br/>
It will generate PNGSs based on the layer name in your Illustrator file.<br/>
File names are generated by using the Illustrator file name with an underscore with the layer name after it.<br/>


# Layers_To_SVG
## This script is intended to be used for icon production
This is roughly the same script as Layers_To_PNG however is saves the file as an SVG.<br/>
Note, there is a slight bug in the naming of the file. <br/>
The file name will have the orginal Illustrator file name but tack on layer names after the underscrore.<br/>


# Roadmap
- [x] Create UI for allowing custom export size of PNG
- [x] Fix SVG naming bug.
